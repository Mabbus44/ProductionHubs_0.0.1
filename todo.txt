TODO
* Unbuildable terrain, exept around resources
* Rail, signals and powerpoles unkillable and buildable everywhere
* Smaller starting area and small/endless resource patches
* Main vault that has population
* All buildings require workers
* Send workers to attack biter bases
* No evolution for killing biternests, only for pollution
* Faster biter expansion when killing nests

So if you dont clear camps the biter attacks will cost you resources (bullets)
Clearing the camps will cost you people.
